### Performance Comparison: REST vs gRPC

| Method          | Local                | Same-Zone | Different Region |
|-----------------|----------------------|-----------|------------------|
| REST add        |2.825 ms per operation |3.126 ms per operation|296.878 ms per operation|
| gRPC add        |0.780 ms per operation |0.919 ms per operation|145.984 ms per operation|
| REST rawimg     |6.649 ms per operation |8.931 ms per operation |1201.090 ms per operation|
| gRPC rawimg     |10.043 ms per operation|12.877 ms per operation|207.0195 ms per operation|
| REST dotproduct |3.504 ms per operation |4.081 ms per operation|298.196 ms per operation|
| gRPC dotproduct |0.657 ms per operation |0.956 ms per operation|146.247 ms per operation|
| REST jsonimg    |35.720 ms per operation|50.754 ms per operation|1346.073 ms per operation|
| gRPC jsonimg    |22.517 ms per operation|35.909 ms per operation|230.274 ms per operation|
| PING            |                       |0.333 ms               |142 ms                  |




From the preformance table, we can see that gRPC consistently outperforms REST across all methods, especially with tasks involving higher latency. In local and same-zone environments, the performance gap is noticeable but not drastic. We can also see that gRPC is 3 to 5 times faster for most methods. 

However, in different-region environments, where network latency is much higher (reflected in the PING of 142 ms), the difference becomes much more pronounced. This is largely due to REST opening a new TCP connection for each request, which incurs significant overhead, particularly in high-latency environments. In contrast, gRPC uses a single persistent TCP connection for all queries, reducing the impact of latency and resulting in faster execution times.

Also, gRPC's performance with heavy tasks like `rawimgage`, `jsonimage` is not as dramatically better in local and same-zone environments (10.043 ms for gRPC vs. 6.649 ms for REST). However, as network latency increases, gRPC still maintains better performance for large data (e.g., jsonimg in different-region: 230.274 ms for gRPC vs. 1346.073 ms for REST), demonstrating its resilience in transferring heavier data in challenging network conditions. For applications with a high number of requests and significant latency, such as those spanning across regions, gRPC offers better scalability due to its efficient connection reuse and binary protocol. RESTâ€™s overhead grows exponentially with network distance, making it less ideal for these types of distributed systems.
